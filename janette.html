		<h1>Janette Donoghue</h1>

<p>I am a primary teacher.
I have always tried to inspire
young people to develop their own creativity. I believe
that the people of Scotland are very resilient and will
strive to create positivity from a difficult situation, as is
		with our current Covid 19 crisis.</p>
<p>During lockdown I decided
it would be a great
opportunity to teach myself to paint and draw.
I spent
most of the week preparing home learning for the
young people I had been teaching then gave myself a
		target of at least one painting a week.</p>
<p>The first paintings were terrible. Over time I learned to
be a bit more creative with the colours from the
numerous mistakes made. My skills have improved
enormously in a few months. I attempted to paint
pictures that were a real challenge but each small step
		led to a better outcome.</p>
In this exhibition consisting of a handful of contributors I
hope to show examples of resilience and creativity from
		some of the people of Scotland.</p></div>
